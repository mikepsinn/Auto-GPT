Response from FDA-Optimization-Agent: The FDA's mission is to protect public health by ensuring the safety, efficacy, and security of human and animal drugs, biological products, medical devices, our nation's food supply, cosmetics, and products that emit radiation. The FDA works to achieve its mission by setting standards for product safety and effectiveness, conducting research, evaluating the results of scientific studies, and taking appropriate enforcement action on products that are found to be unsafe or ineffective. As for its limitations, the FDA is a regulatory agency with limited resources and cannot test every single product on the market. Therefore, it relies on manufacturers to provide accurate and truthful information about their products. Additionally, there may be delays in the approval process due to the large volume of applications and the complexity of the review process.
